I want some of the description to talk about how we are so focused o nusing AI to go from unstrucutred verbal language
to strucutred tabular data, when actually the real key is transforming already strucutred data into complex unstrucutred natural language.

Are brains are not made to ingest clearly organized strucutred data, but we are born to take complext mathematical data trhough 
trhough natuaral language. xlsonic makes this happen thanks to AI.

The pricing schemes should be even more outragesly and unnecessarly complex, tokens, word-cells (call them wells per second on transonificAItion)


the 3 samples should be named more approtietlu, the frist is the headers, the second is the frist row and the 3 is a sample of a random row.
